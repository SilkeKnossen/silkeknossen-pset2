This app includes the story creating game called "Mad Libs". The first view introduces you to the app and explain how it works. You can pick a story you like to create and click the start button. Then, you go to a view where you have to fill in a couple of words to complete the story. The title of the navigation bar tells you the index of the word you are filling in. You can also see how many words you still have to fill in and which type of word you have to enter. If you have filled in all words, the app shows you the next view with the resulting story.
